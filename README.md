# Best Model Selection and Analysis

## Best Overall Model
**CatBoost Regressor** demonstrates the most accurate predictions with:
- **Lowest RMSE:** 624.41
- **High R¬≤ score:** 0.9338
- **MAPE:** 7.5%

This combination indicates excellent predictive accuracy and strong variance explanation, making CatBoost the most reliable model for precise sales forecasting.

## Close Contenders
- **XGBoost Regressor:**  
  RMSE of 642.07 and R¬≤ of 0.93 , closely following CatBoost, showing competitive performance in capturing data relationships.
- **PyCaret (with multiple regressors):**  
  RMSE of 1,073,553.77, though higher than boosting models, still provides valuable insights but with less precision, despite a good R¬≤ score.

## Forecasting Models
- **Prophet with Additional Regressors (promos, holidays, etc.):**  
  Outperforms other models with an impressive RMSE of **525,387.66**, indicating improved modeling of seasonal patterns and events.
- **Prophet with Holiday Effects Only:**  
  Also performs well but doesn't match the accuracy of the regressors-enhanced version.

## Deep Learning
- **LSTM Model:**  
  Achieves an RMSE of **916.26**, indicating potential but still higher than the top boosting models. It suggests that further tuning or utilizing more data could improve its performance.

---

## Explanation & Analysis

### RMSE as a Metric
- **Prioritized** because it penalizes large errors heavily, which is critical in sales forecasting to avoid costly mispredictions.

### Best Tools & Techniques
- **Tree-based ensemble models (CatBoost, XGBoost):**  
  Excel at handling structured, tabular data and capturing complex relationships.
- **Prophet:**  
  Demonstrates excellent seasonality and event modeling, especially when augmented with regressors.
- **LSTM (Deep Learning):**  
  Offers promising results but may require further tuning, more data, or architectural adjustments for better accuracy.

---

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis:
- **CatBoost** is the most reliable and accurate predictor owing to its lowest RMSE and high R¬≤ score.
- It is recommended for deployment to ensure precise and stable sales forecasts.

This selection ensures optimal performance for business intelligence, planning, and strategic decision-making.

#### üîπ Slicer Implementation Strategy  
üîπ Slicers were added selectively on interactive pages (e.g., Store Performance & Time Series Forecasting) to allow user-driven filtering.  

üîπ Static summary pages such as the KPI Overview and Sales Snapshot were intentionally designed without slicers to ensure clean, distraction-free insights.  

üîπ This approach balances interactivity with simplicity, and aligns with Power BI best practices for business reporting.

<h1 id="dAX_overview_for_rossmann_store_sales_analysis"> DAX Overview for Rossmann Store Sales Analysis </h1>

**Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)** are formulas used in Power BI to create dynamic measures and calculated columns, enabling sophisticated data analysis and reporting.

In this project, DAX was essential for calculating key metrics such as total sales, customer counts, and promotional impacts, which are visualized in our Power BI dashboard.

<h2 id="key_dAX_measures"> Key DAX Measures </h2>
Here are some of the core measures used:

- **Total Sales:** Calculates the sum of all sales amount.
```sql
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales])
```
- **Total Customers:** Counts the total number of customers.
```sql
Customers Count = CALCULATE(COUNT(Sales[Customers]),ALLEXCEPT(Sales,Sales[Day of Week]))
```
- **Average Daily Sales:** Computes the average sales per day.
```sql
Average Daily Sales = AVERAGEX(VALUES(Sales[Date]),CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Sales])))
```
- **Sales with Promotion:** Sum of sales made during promotional days.
```sql
Sales With Promo = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Sales]), Sales[Promo] = 1)
```

*Note:* For a complete list of all DAX measures and calculated columns, [click here to see the full formulas](https://github.com/rotimi2020/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/rossmann_store_sales_analysis/dax/dax_formulas.txt).
